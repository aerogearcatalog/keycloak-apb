// tag::provisioning-auth[]

* *Keycloak admin username*: Username for Keycloak administration 

* *Keycloak admin password*: Password for the Keycloak admin user

* *Name of the Keycloak realm*: Name of the keycloak realm. (defaults to current namespace)

* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.

* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.
